# `go-dev`

A simple and robust orchestrator for streamlining local development environments in monorepos.

**`npx go-dev <preset>` ‚Äì Go develop!**

## üöÄ Introduction

In complex monorepos, starting your development environment can be a chore. You might need to spin up Docker containers, run multiple Node.js (or other language) development servers, handle pre-builds, and manage inter-service dependencies. `go-dev` simplifies this by allowing you to define your entire local development stack in a single YAML configuration file.

`go-dev` acts as a central command to bring up your `api`, `frontend`, `database`, and any other microservices, ensuring they start in the correct order, with the right modes, and provide clear, prefixed logs.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Unified Configuration:** Define all your services, their modes (e.g., `dev`, `docker`, `serve`), and dependencies in a single `go-dev.yml` file.
*   **Service Types:**
    *   **`cmd` services:** Run any command-line process (e.g., `npm run dev`, `rollup -w`, `python app.py`). Supports `preCommands` for setup tasks like builds. Commands can be defined in multiple flexible ways to run single or multiple processes in parallel for a service.
    *   **`docker` services:** Manage Docker containers via `docker compose`. Automatically checks container status and performs health checks.
*   **Mode-Aware Dependencies:** Services can depend on other services running in specific modes (e.g., your `api` dev mode might depend on `frontend` in `serve` mode).
*   **Preset-Driven Startup:** Define different "presets" (e.g., `api`, `frontend`, `all`) to easily spin up specific combinations of services tailored to your current development focus.
*   **Automatic Dependency Resolution:** `go-dev` builds an intelligent execution graph, starting services in the correct topological order.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Prefixes logs from each service, making it easy to follow activity from multiple concurrent processes.
*   **Automatic Process Exit:** The `go-dev` process will automatically exit when all primary services (those directly listed in the chosen preset) exit cleanly (with a success code of `0`).
*   **Precise Docker Cleanup:** `go-dev` intelligently tracks which Docker Compose services it **actively started** (i.e., those that were not already running). During cleanup, it will only stop these specific services, leaving any pre-existing containers untouched.
*   **Robust Cleanup:** Handles graceful shutdown of all started processes and Docker services on exit (e.g., via `Ctrl+C` or automatic exit).

## ü§î Why `go-dev`?

While tools like `concurrently` manage parallel processes and `docker compose` handles containers, `go-dev` fills a crucial gap by:

*   **Integrating `cmd` and `docker` services seamlessly:** It bridges the world of host-based processes and containerized applications under one roof.
*   **Providing intelligent mode-aware dependency resolution:** It understands that "frontend" might mean a different set of commands (and dependencies) when you're actively developing the frontend vs. when it's just a dependency for API development.
*   **Offering a single, declarative interface for your entire dev stack:** No more remembering multiple `npm` scripts or `docker compose` commands.

## üì¶ Installation

`go-dev` is distributed via npm and designed to be used with `npx`.

```bash
# Install it as a devDependency in your monorepo's root
npm install --save-dev go-dev
# or
yarn add --dev go-dev
```

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed, simply run `go-dev` with the name of the preset you want to start:

```bash
npx go-dev <preset_name> [config_path]
```

*   `<preset_name>`: The name of the preset defined in your `go-dev.yml` (e.g., `api`, `frontend`, `all`).
*   `[config_path]`: (Optional) Path to your `go-dev.yml` file. Defaults to looking for `go-dev.yml`, `.go-dev.yml`, `go-dev.yaml`, or `.go-dev.yaml` in the current directory.

**Passing Arguments to Service Commands:**

To pass additional arguments from the command line to a specific service command, use a keyword flag followed by the target and its arguments.

By default, the keyword flag is `--args-for`. This can be customized in your `go-dev.yml` using the `serviceArgsKeyword` option (e.g., `serviceArgsKeyword: pass-to`).

The target for arguments is specified as `<service_name>[:<command_index>]`:

Specify the target for arguments as `<service_name>:<command_index>` (e.g., `api:0`, `frontend:1`). The `command_index` is 0-based and refers to the position of the command within a service's `commands` array. If the `:<command_index>` part is omitted (e.g., just `<service_name>`), arguments are passed to the **first command (index `0`)** defined for that service.

You can combine multiple keyword flag blocks for different services or specific commands.

```bash
npx go-dev <preset_name> [--<serviceArgsKeyword> <service_name>[:<command_index>] [args...] ] [...]
```

Example:

Consider an `api` service with two parallel commands: `api:0` (main server) and `api:1` (TypeScript compiler watch).

```bash
npx go-dev all \
  --args-for api:0 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081 \
  --args-for api:1 --pretty --diagnostics \
  --args-for frontend --log-level verbose
```
*In the example above, `--args-for frontend` is equivalent to `--args-for frontend:0`.*

Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to gracefully shut down all running services. `go-dev` will also automatically exit once all primary services (those directly listed in your chosen preset) have completed their execution cleanly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`go-dev.yml`)

Create a configuration file in your project's root.

By default, `go-dev` automatically detects its configuration file. It looks for files named `go-dev` (or `.go-dev` for a hidden file), optionally including `.config` before the `.yml` or `.yaml` extension. It will search for these files in the directory where you run `npx go-dev`.

Common examples include: `go-dev.yml`, `.go-dev.yml`, and `go-dev.config.yaml`.

```yaml
# go-dev.yml

# Customize the keyword used to pass arguments to service commands from the CLI.
# Change this if 'args-for' conflicts with a command your services use.
serviceArgsKeyword: args-for # Default value

# Define your individual services here
services:
  # Example: A Docker-based PostgreSQL database
  postgres:
    type: docker         # This service runs inside Docker
    service: postgres    # Name of the service in your docker-compose.yml
    composeFile: infrastructure/docker-compose.yml # Path to the docker-compose file
    healthCheck: true    # Enable health checks for this Docker service

  # Example: Your API service, which can run in 'dev' (cmd) or 'docker' mode
  api:
    type: hybrid         # This service has multiple modes
    defaultMode: dev     # Default mode if not specified by a preset or dependency
    # Note: The name of the modes is totally arbitrary
    modes:
      # API in active development mode (runs directly on host)
      dev:
        type: cmd             # This mode runs a command-line process
        # The 'commands' property can be specified in three ways:
        # 1. As a simple array of strings (for a single command without extra options)
        #    commands: [npx, rollup, -c, -w]
        # 2. As a single command object (for one command with options like 'directory' or 'restartOnError')
        #    commands:
        #      command: [npx, rollup, -c, -w]
        #      directory: ./api
        #      restartOnError: true # Default is true for 'cmd' services
        # 3. As an array of command objects (for multiple parallel commands)
        commands:
          - command: [npx, rollup, -c, -w] # The primary command for development (index 0)
            directory: ./api      # Directory to run the command from
            # restartOnError: true # (Optional, defaults to true)
          # Example of a second parallel command for API (index 1)
          # - command: [npx, tsc, --watch]
          #   directory: ./api
        dependencies:         # What this mode depends on
          - postgres          # API dev needs PostgreSQL (will use postgres's default docker mode)
          - { service: frontend, mode: serve } # API dev needs frontend running in its 'serve' mode

      # API running as a Docker container (e.g., for frontend-only dev)
      docker:
        type: docker
        service: api
        composeFile: infrastructure/docker-compose.yml
        healthCheck: true
        dependencies:
          - postgres # Docker API also needs PostgreSQL

  # Example: Your Frontend service, which can run in 'dev' (cmd) or 'serve' (cmd) mode
  frontend:
    type: hybrid
    defaultMode: dev
    modes:
      # Frontend in active development (watch mode)
      dev:
        type: cmd
        commands:
          command: [npx, rollup, -c, -w]
          directory: ./frontend
        dependencies:
          # Frontend dev needs API (will use api's default docker mode for this preset)
          # Note: No direct circular dependency between dev modes.
          # Dev modes often assume peers will eventually be ready.
          - { service: api, mode: docker } 

      # Frontend serving its built assets (e.g., when API depends on it)
      serve:
        type: cmd
        preCommands: # Commands to run and await completion BEFORE the main command
          - [npm, --prefix, frontend, run, build] # Build frontend assets first
        commands:
          command: [node, ./localserver.mjs] # Then start the local server
          directory: ./frontend
        dependencies:
          - api # Frontend serve needs API (will use api's default dev mode for this preset)


# Define different development presets (combinations of services and their modes)
presets:
  # Preset: "api" development focus
  # Starts API in dev mode, pulling in its dependencies (postgres, frontend:serve)
  api:
    services: [api] # Only explicitly list top-level services you want to run
    modes:
      # no explicit modes needed here, as defaultMode and dependency requests handle it
      # api: dev # (already default)
      # frontend: serve # (requested by api:dev)
      # postgres: dev # (pulled by dependencies)

  # Preset: "frontend" development focus
  # Starts Frontend in dev mode, pulling in its dependencies (api:docker, postgres)
  frontend:
    services: [frontend]
    modes:
      # frontend: dev # (already default)
      # api: docker # (requested by frontend:dev)
      # postgres: dev # (pulled by dependencies)

  # Preset: "all" development (both API and Frontend in dev mode concurrently)
  all:
    services: [api, frontend] # Explicitly list both as top-level focus
    modes:
      # api: dev # (already default)
      # frontend: dev # (already default)
      # No need to specify modes if they match the defaultMode
```
